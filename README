This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1591

This script is based in the matlab syntax file, however it adds a few significant features:

* Supports the octave syntax, including things like endwhile, the # comment, the strings delimited by ' and ", etc.

* Highlights the predefined functions like normal_cdf, sqrt, etc...

* Highlights any functions defined in the file being editted, for example if you are editting a file containing something like this:

function my_function()
  ...
endfunction

it will highlight appearances of my_function in the current file.
